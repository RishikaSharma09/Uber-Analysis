🚖 Uber Data Analysis
This project analyzes the Uber dataset to uncover insights about ride demand, time-based trends, and usage patterns.Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), the dataset was explored to answer key questions like:
When do people book the most rides?
Are weekends busier than weekdays?
What are the peak hours for Uber rides?
